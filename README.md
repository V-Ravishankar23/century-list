# Century List
**# If you had a century to live, what 100 things can you accomplish**

**#> Hi,
My name is Vivek and I started this exercise at the beginning of 2018. The first time I made this list I realized I had already done a lot of cool stuff, so just for fun I also listed the [things I would have put on here if I hadn't already done them] (../master/done-before-2018.md)

These items shift with priority over the years.  Once an item is completed it stays on the list, so you can only alternate what is left.  Here is my **Century List**.
